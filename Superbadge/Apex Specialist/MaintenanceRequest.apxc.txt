     * you create a new maintenance request for a future routine checkup. 
     * This new request is tied to the same vehicle and piece of equipment to be serviced as the original closed service request.
     * This new request's Type should be set as Routine Maintenance. 
     * The Subject should not be null and the Report Date field reflects the day the request was created. 
     * Another aspect about parts is they all have different lifespans. 
     * Therefore, you need to calculate and set the next due date using the maintenance cycle defined on the related work part records. 
     * If multiple work parts are used in the maintenance request, choose the shortest maintenance cycle to define the service date.
