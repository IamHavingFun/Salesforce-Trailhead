/*Write a class that makes a REST callout to an external warehouse system to get a list of equipment that needs to be updated. 
 * The calloutâ€™s JSON response returns the equipment records that you upsert in Salesforce. 
 * Beyond inventory, you also ensure that other potential warehouse changes carry over to Salesforce. 
 * Your class maps the following fields: replacement part (always true), cost, current inventory, lifespan, maintenance cycle, and warehouse SKU. 
 * Use the warehouse SKU as the external ID to identify which equipment records to update within Salesforce.
